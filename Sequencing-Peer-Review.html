        <tr>
            <td><strong>ENGAGEMENT</strong><br>
            The instructor uses strategies designed to engage learner interest, determine what learners know about the topic and identify any misconceptions.</td>
            <td>
                Provide slides based on a Simpsons vacation scenario to engage students and introduce the subjunctive mood (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JPQdCYHRl3IbMlwz8ezTKFef6TgEssp7XLLVBveiXWk/edit?usp=sharing">Slides Link</a>).<br>

            </td>
            <td>
                Students share personal experiences related to vacations or traveling, using hypothetical expressions (e.g., "¿Qué harías si ganaras la lotería?", "¿A dónde viajarías si pudieras elegir cualquier lugar del mundo?").<br>
                Initial exposure to subjunctive forms embedded in everyday contexts to spark interest and curiosity.

        <tr>
            <td><strong>EXPLORATION</strong><br>

        <tr>
            <td><strong>EXPLANATION</strong><br>
            Learners use their own words to explain their activities, and to listen critically to one another, clarifying and correcting explanations along with the instructor. Links are made between learner explanations and their previous experiences. Instructor introduces more formal explanations and terminology.</td>
            <td>
                Clearly explain the subjunctive mood, including grammatical structures, usage rules, and common expressions, using examples like "Es importante que vengas temprano."

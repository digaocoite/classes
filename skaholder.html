    <p>The module introduces the foundational concepts of informal learning and helps learners transform that understanding into the skill of designing a personalized informal learning plan through a sequence of scaffolded activities. First, we use a reflective strategy to support conceptual understanding by having learners participate in a discussion where they identify and share past informal learning experiences. This activity encourages learners to engage in Analyzing and Evaluating, as they connect theory to personal context and assess the value of their experiences. The discussion is supported by a discussion board (Collaboration Tool).</p>

    <p>Next, we incorporate a modeling strategy by asking learners to view real-world examples of experiential learning and record a video reflection connecting those examples to their own goals. This activity fosters Applying and Analyzing, as learners interpret and adapt examples to their own development. The learner will utilize any video recording tool to capture their reflection and post it to the discussion board to share with their classmates to be able to learn from each other's experiences.</p>

    <p>Finally, we scaffold Creating by having learners design a personalized informal learning plan that includes diverse resources, a structured timeline, and clear goals. This culminating activity aligns directly with the module’s objective and is supported by the LMS assignment feature (Assessment Tool), allowing for both submission and evaluation of learner-designed plans.</p>

        <p>The instructional design of this module strongly aligns with the elements outlined in Figure 2.5 from <em>Meaningful Online Learning</em>, specifically in fostering engaged, authentic, and personalized learning experiences. Through activities such as the discussion on informal learning and the creation of a personalized learning plan, students are encouraged to connect course content to their lived experiences, making the learning relevant and meaningful. The video reflection promotes learner voice and choice, as students select examples that resonate with their own professional goals, supporting personalization and autonomy. The inclusion of multimedia resources and scaffolded tasks supports active engagement and multiple modes of representation, addressing diverse learning preferences. Additionally, the peer response component cultivates collaborative learning and a sense of community. Overall, the design not only meets cognitive needs but also considers motivational and emotional engagement, making it a strong example of meaningful online instruction.</p>

            <h3>Greeting</h3>
            <p>
                Thank you for agreeing to participate in this interview regarding the evaluation of the use of Kahoot for Social Studies. Your feedback today will help provide better insight into the use of Kahoot as a tool for learning and understanding in social studies. You will provide feedback to a series of questions, you may discuss other elements of the Kahoot app for learning if they are not discussed, and you will complete a series of tasks relating to the usability of Kahoot (<em>see usability tasks “For Teachers” below</em>).
